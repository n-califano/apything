## 📚 Documentation

[TODO] Full documentation (will be) available (at some point in the future) at [apything.readthedocs.io](https://apything.readthedocs.io)

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
pip install apything
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n-califano/apything
cd apything
pip install -e .
```

## 🧩 Usage

Waiting for proper documentation the best alternative is to read the tests in the **tests** folder

## 🧪 Running Tests

- Configure the _tests\config.yml_ with the url and the api key of your anythingLLM installation
- Make sure your anythingLLM is enabled for multi user, otherwise some tests will fail
- Run
  ```python
  cd tests
  python run_tests.py
  ```
